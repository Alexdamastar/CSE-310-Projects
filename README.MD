We created a hash table that uses separate chaining with linked lists to handle collisions, where each slot can store multiple key-value pairs. The program is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the custom hash function by printing the contents of the first 5 slots, displaying the length of each slot (collision chain length), and calculating the standard deviation of slot lengths to measure the distribution quality of the hash function. For the hash function, we used added values of each character in the string value and multiplied by a constant and then we did it again but skipping every other character to get our hash value. The hash value is then modded by the size of the table and then elements are inserted accordingly.
